# file-reader

A simple skill that lets me read text files you drop into my data folder.

## Purpose
You can save .txt, .md, or other text files to `skills/file-reader/data/` and I can read them on demand.

## Usage
- **"Read the file about Julien"** — I'll look for it and read it
- **"What files do I have?"** — I'll list what's in the data folder
- **"Read character-notes.txt"** — I'll grab that specific file

## Data folder
Drop files into: `skills/file-reader/data/`

I'll be able to list them, read them, and pull info from them as needed.
